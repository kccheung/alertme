always remember that this isn't a "shopify monitor" or "restock monitor", it just watches for even the smallest change in the content of a site.
So if it starts spamming your twitter feed make sure you're there to turn it off etc. to avoid getting banned or losting all your followers.
Same thing with the email, it will spam until you can turn it off essentially.
